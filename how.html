      <h2>How to calculate and monitor your net worth</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="area">
      <p>Periodicallymonitoring your net worth is a good way to get a quick snapshot as to whether or not you are improving or financial situation over time your net worth is simply what you own minus what you owe,</p>
      <p> what you own are your assets and what you owe are your liabilities we'll start with a simple example before we dig a little deeper.</p>
      <p></p>
    </div>

    <div class="area">
      <h2>An Example</h2>
      <p>Let's suppose Jeremy wants to calculate his net worth, he'll start by listing all his assets he has a $300,000 home, a $20,000 car, $5,000 in a checking account and $15,000 in his tax-free savings account adding up all his assets what he owns comes to three hundred and forty thousand dollars, next he'll list all his</p>
      <p>liabilities he has a $200,000 balance remaining on his mortgage, his car alone has a balance of $15,000, he carries $3,000 on his credit cards from month to month, and he has a student loan of 27,000 dollars, adding up all his liabilities what he owes comes to two hundred and forty five thousand dollars,</p>
      <p>now when we take what he owns, three hundred and forty thousand dollars and subtract what he owes two hundred and forty-five thousand dollars,Jeremy's net worth is ninety five thousand dollars.</p>
